#Food Truck Application

###Description
This food truck app will allow you to select up to 5 food trucks of your choosing, give them a rating, and say what type of food is served. The app will then automatically generate and assign a unique ID for each of the food trucks. A display will then prompt the user with four option. 1) List all food trucks. 2) List the average rating off all of the food trucks entered. 3) List the highest rated food truck and all of the food trucks information. 4) quit. This menu will loop through as many times as the user wishes until they enter option 4 and choose to quit. They will then receive the message, "Goodbye" and the program will stop.

###Lessons Learned
This assignment was VERY difficult for me. I learned how to properly use getters and setters (I had initially used them wrong) and was able to correct it with the help of a TA. I also learned how to set up a scanner to take user input and place the input into an array. I had a particularly hard time with the average and highest rating. Figuring out how to properly set up the body of each was challenging and took me quite a while. I learned that I need a lot more practice getting the fundamentals down.
